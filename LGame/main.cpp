/// The purpose of this project is to attempt to re-create the L-Game.
/// The L game is a two-player game played on a board of 4x4 squares.
/// Each player takes a turn moving a 3x2 L piece to a new position.
/// Either player wins by trapping the other player, making it so they cannot move their L piece.
///
